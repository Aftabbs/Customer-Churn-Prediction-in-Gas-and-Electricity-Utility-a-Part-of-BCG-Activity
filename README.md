### Customer Churn Prediction in Gas and Electricity Utility
* Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the SME segment of a major gas and electricity utility company. The aim is to develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churn and provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn rates.

# Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

* Data Exploration and Preprocessing: In this stage, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data, handled missing values, performed feature engineering, and prepared the data for model training.

* Model Development: We built machine learning models to predict customer churn using the prepared data. Two models were developed: a Random Forest Classifier and an XGBoost Classifier.

* Model Evaluation: We evaluated the performance of the developed models using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we analyzed the confusion matrix to gain further insights into the model's predictive capabilities.

* Recommendations: Based on the analysis, we provided actionable recommendations to address the churn problem. These recommendations include targeted retention strategies, improving customer experience, and considering competitive pricing strategies.

* Files and Folders
The repository contains the following files and folders:

data/client_data.csv: Dataset containing customer information and churn labels.
data/price_data.csv: Dataset containing historical price information.

# Conclusion
This project has provided valuable insights into the customer churn problem in the gas and electricity utility industry. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we have developed models capable of predicting churn and provided recommendations to mitigate it.

By implementing the recommendations, the utility company can improve customer retention, enhance customer experience, and potentially increase revenue.
